# Sitrep Situation Report
For those of you that have been wondering like me, what I am doing
## Junie SINS
Junie, the large language model from JetBrains, indeed, sins.
She is very good at writing code and she can even write code from user stories which is impressive but she goes off in the wrong direction and I am left with a lot of code that I cannot reconstruct but having said that, this code does inform me and I can model from it.

## WebLogic Sucks
In test we have been struggling to communicate with WebLogic from our testware, namely JMeter.
I have a model on sim61 which works and when I put the same model on AWS, it does not work. 
So I tried to look at the backend i.e. the code.
To this end, I deployed WebLogic in a container and tried to engineer a message using the recommended wlthint3client. 
At the moment I'm still unable to connect to the queue in WebLogic using java running in the IntelliJ IDE.

I have also installed JMeter but dreamed of coding an interface myself, so did not try it with this setup as yet.

# Conclusion 
LLM can inform you about the code and produce code quickly.
It cannot, in this users experience, develop.

The Java WebLogic model we are still trying to use is out of date. Most of the advice I can find is at least five years old and usually 10.
The interface is overcomplicated and probably not stable. 
We should move away from this model.
