# Sitrep Situation Report
for those of you that have been wondering like me, what I am doing
## Junie SINS
Journey the large language model from Japanese beans indeed sins she is very good at writing code but and she can indeed write code from user stories which is indeed impressive but she goes off in the wrong direction and I am left with a lot of code. I cannot reconstruct, but having said that this code does inform me as an encore and I can model from it.

## WebLogic Sucks
in test we have been struggling to communicate with with logic from our tester namely J meter I have a model on Sim 61 which works and when I put the same model on a UWS it does not work. So I tried to look at the backend i.e. the code to the end deployed with logic in a container and Pueblo Klein is run from a Java STE. At the moment I'm still unable to connect to the queue in Web logic using the Java using the web logic client.

# Conclusion 
Lost LLM can inform you about the code and produce code quickly they cannot in this use experience develop the Java Web logic model we are still trying to use is out of date. Most of the advice I can find about. It is at least five years old and usually 10 the interface is overcomplicated and probably not stable. We should move away from this model.
